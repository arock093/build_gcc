This is so I can save my gnu cross compiler build scripts for various
targets.  This is how I build the compilers I am using for the other
examples.  Also a clang/llvm script as well.

clang/llvm only needs one build as it is by nature a cross compiler.

these scripts were derived from a script found in the mpx project at
opencores.org.
